Certainly! Here are 20 Python exercise questions focusing on the concept of variables, distributed across basic, intermediate, and advanced levels:

### Basic Level:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - Declare two variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them values 5 and 8, respectively. Print their sum.

2. **Variable Types:**
   - Declare a variable `my_var` with a value of 3.14. Determine its type and print the result.

3. **Variable Swap:**
   - Swap the values of two variables, `a` and `b`. Print the updated values.

4. **String Concatenation:**
   - Create two string variables, `first_name` and `last_name`. Concatenate them to form a full name and print it.

5. **Variable Reassignment:**
   - Declare a variable `count` and assign it an initial value of 10. Reassign the variable with a new value and print it.

### Intermediate Level:

6. **Multiple Assignments:**
   - Assign values 3, 5, and 7 to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` in a single line. Print their product.

7. **Floating-Point Precision:**
   - Declare a variable `pi` with the value of Ï€ (pi) rounded to 5 decimal places. Print the result.

8. **Boolean Variables:**
   - Declare a variable `is_python_fun` and assign it a boolean value. Print a statement based on its value.

9. **Variable Scope:**
   - Create a function that takes a parameter and prints the variable both inside and outside the function.

10. **List Variables:**
    - Declare a list variable `fruits` containing three fruit names. Print the list.

### Advanced Level:

11. **Tuple Unpacking:**
    - Create a tuple with three values and unpack them into three variables. Print the variables.

12. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
    - Create a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs representing student names and their ages. Print the dictionary.

13. **Global vs Local Variables:**
    - Declare a global variable and a function that modifies a local variable with the same name. Print both variables.

14. **Variable Annotations:**
    - Use variable annotations to declare a variable `population` with the value of 7 billion. Print the value.

15. **Variable Shadowing:**
    - Create a variable with a global scope. Inside a function, create a variable with the same name. Print both variables.

16. **Multiple Variable Swaps:**
    - Swap the values of three variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) without using temporary variables. Print the updated values.

17. **Variable Augmented Assignment:**
    - Declare a variable `counter` and increment it using the augmented assignment operator. Print the result.

18. **Enumerate and Variables:**
    - Use the `enumerate` function to iterate over a list of animals and print both the 
    index and the animal name.

19. **Variable Deletion:**
    - Declare a variable `temp` with a value. Delete the variable using the `del` keyword. 
    Attempt to print it afterward.

20. **Function as a Variable:**
    - Create a function that calculates the square of a number. Assign the function to a
     variable and use it to calculate the square of 9.
