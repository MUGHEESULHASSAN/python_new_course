ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are five program exercises as blueprints for polymorphism in Python:

Exercise 1: Shape Class Blueprint with Area Calculation
Create a blueprint for a Shape class with a method calculate_area(). Implement subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each 
inheriting from the Shape class and providing their own calculate_area() method to calculate the area for specific shapes.

Exercise 2: Animal Class Blueprint with Different Sounds
Design a blueprint for an Animal class with a method make_sound(). Implement subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird, each inheriting from 
the Animal class and providing their own make_sound() method to produce different sounds.

Exercise 3: Employee Class Blueprint with Multiple Pay Methods
Create a blueprint for an Employee class with a method calculate_pay(). Implement subclasses like SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, 
and CommissionedEmployee, each inheriting from the Employee class and providing their own calculate_pay() method for calculating pay 
based on different payment structures.

Exercise 4: File Reader Class Blueprint with Multiple Formats
Design a blueprint for a FileReader class with a method read_file(). Implement subclasses like TextFileReader, CSVFileReader, and 
JSONFileReader, each inheriting from the FileReader class and providing their own read_file() method to read files in different formats.

Exercise 5: Math Operation Class Blueprint with Various Operations
Create a blueprint for a MathOperation class with a method perform_operation(). Implement subclasses like Addition, Subtraction, and 
Multiplication, each inheriting from the MathOperation class and providing their own perform_operation() method to carry out specific mathematical operations.

These program exercises demonstrate polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base 
class and have different behaviors based on their specific class implementations. You can implement these concepts by defining the 
classes and using polymorphism to perform different operations or calculations based on the specific subclass at runtime in Python code.
