write 5 program exercise just concept on make blue print only of inheritance or single inheritance in python  
ChatGPT
Sure! Here are five program exercises as blueprints for single inheritance in Python:

Exercise 1: Animal Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for an Animal class with methods like speak() and move(). Implement subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird, each inheriting 
from the Animal class and overriding the speak() method with specific animal sounds.

Exercise 2: Vehicle Class Blueprint
Design a blueprint for a Vehicle class with attributes like make, model, and methods like start(), stop(), and drive(). 
Implement subclasses like Car, Bike, and Truck, each inheriting from the Vehicle class and adding specific functionality.

Exercise 3: Shape Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for a Shape class with methods like area() and perimeter(). Implement subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and 
Triangle, each inheriting from the Shape class and overriding the methods to calculate specific shapes' areas and perimeters.

Exercise 4: Employee Class Blueprint
Design a blueprint for an Employee class with attributes like name, employee_id, and methods like get_salary(). Implement subclasses 
like Manager, Developer, and SalesPerson, each inheriting from the Employee class and providing different salary calculation methods.

Exercise 5: Electronic Devices Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for an ElectronicDevice class with attributes like name, power_rating, and methods like turn_on(), turn_off(). 
Implement subclasses like Television, Laptop, and Refrigerator, each inheriting from the ElectronicDevice class and adding specific functionality.

These program exercises serve as blueprints for using single inheritance to create classes with shared attributes and 
methods in a hierarchical manner. You can implement these concepts by defining the classes and using inheritance to create 
subclasses that extend the functionality of the base class.


Certainly! Here are five advanced-level program exercises as blueprints for single inheritance in Python:

Exercise 1: Geometric Shape Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for a Shape class with methods like area() and perimeter(). Implement subclasses like Rectangle, 
Circle, and Triangle, each inheriting from the Shape class and providing methods to calculate the area and perimeter for specific shapes.

Exercise 2: Banking System with Multiple Account Types
Design a blueprint for a BankAccount class with attributes like account_number, account_holder, and balance. 
Implement subclasses like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, each inheriting from the BankAccount class and 
adding specific functionality like interest calculation and checkbook management.

Exercise 3: Online Store Product Hierarchy
Create a blueprint for a Product class with attributes like product_id, name, and price. Implement subclasses 
like Electronics, Clothing, and Books, each inheriting from the Product class and adding specific attributes and methods related to the respective product types.

Exercise 4: School Management System
Design a blueprint for a Person class with attributes like name, age, and methods like get_details(). Implement subclasses 
like Student and Teacher, each inheriting from the Person class and providing additional methods like get_grades() for students and teach_subject() for teachers.

Exercise 5: Online Food Delivery System
Create a blueprint for a Restaurant class with attributes like name, cuisine, and methods like get_menu(). Implement subclasses 
like FastFoodRestaurant and FineDiningRestaurant, each inheriting from the Restaurant class and adding specific menu items and features.

These advanced-level program exercises involve more complex hierarchies and functionality in the subclasses. You can use 
these blueprints to implement single inheritance in Python, creating a hierarchy of classes that share attributes and 
methods while providing specialized behavior in subclasses.
