Certainly! Here are five program exercises as blueprints for multiple inheritance in Python:

Exercise 1: Person and Skills Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for a Person class with attributes like name, age, and methods like get_details(). Design a separate Skills class 
with attributes like programming, communication, and methods like get_skill_rating(). Implement a subclass Employee that inherits from 
both Person and Skills classes to combine personal details and skill ratings.

Exercise 2: Mobile Phone and Camera Class Blueprint
Design a blueprint for a MobilePhone class with attributes like make, model, and methods like call(), text(). Create a separate Camera 
class with attributes like resolution, zoom, and methods like take_photo(). Implement a subclass Smartphone that inherits from both MobilePhone 
and Camera classes to combine mobile phone and camera functionalities.

Exercise 3: Student and Course Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for a Student class with attributes like name, roll_number, and methods like get_details(). Design a separate Course class 
with attributes like course_name, credits, and methods like get_course_info(). Implement a subclass EnrolledStudent that inherits from both 
Student and Course classes to represent a student enrolled in a particular course.

Exercise 4: Animal and Flyer Class Blueprint
Design a blueprint for an Animal class with attributes like species, habitat, and methods like eat(), sleep(). Create a separate Flyer class 
with attributes like wing_span, fly_speed, and methods like take_off(), land(). Implement a subclass Bird that inherits from both Animal and 
Flyer classes to represent a bird species that can fly.

Exercise 5: Employee and Department Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for an Employee class with attributes like name, employee_id, and methods like get_details(). Design a separate Department 
class with attributes like department_name, supervisor, and methods like get_department_info(). Implement a subclass DepartmentEmployee that 
inherits from both Employee and Department classes to represent an employee belonging to a specific department.

These program exercises involve multiple inheritance, where a subclass inherits from two or more base classes. Multiple inheritance allows 
combining features and behaviors from multiple classes to create more specialized and complex classes. You can implement these concepts by 
defining the classes and using multiple inheritance to create the class hierarchy in Python code.
