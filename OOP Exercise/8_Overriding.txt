ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are five program exercises as blueprints for method overriding in Python:

Exercise 1: Animal Class Blueprint with Sound
Create a blueprint for an Animal class with a method make_sound(). Implement subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird, each inheriting from the 
Animal class and overriding the make_sound() method to produce different sounds.

Exercise 2: Shape Class Blueprint with Area Calculation
Design a blueprint for a Shape class with a method calculate_area(). Implement subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each 
inheriting from the Shape class and overriding the calculate_area() method to calculate the area for specific shapes.

Exercise 3: Employee Class Blueprint with Pay Calculation
Create a blueprint for an Employee class with a method calculate_pay(). Implement subclasses like SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, and 
CommissionedEmployee, each inheriting from the Employee class and overriding the calculate_pay() method to calculate pay based on different payment structures.

Exercise 4: Parent Class Blueprint with Display Method
Design a blueprint for a Parent class with a method display(). Implement subclasses like Child1 and Child2, each inheriting from the Parent 
class and overriding the display() method to display specific information for each child class.

Exercise 5: Calculator Class Blueprint with Addition Method
Create a blueprint for a Calculator class with a method add(). Implement a subclass ScientificCalculator that inherits from the Calculator 
class and overrides the add() method to add two numbers and return the result in scientific notation.

These program exercises demonstrate method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined 
in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass takes precedence over the method in the parent class. You can implement these concepts 
by defining the classes and using method overriding to provide different implementations of the same method in Python code.
