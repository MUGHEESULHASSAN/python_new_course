You are right. Here are five program exercises as blueprints for multi-level inheritance in Python:

Exercise 1: Animal Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for an Animal class with methods like speak() and move(). Implement subclasses like Mammal, Bird, and Fish, each inheriting from the Animal class. 
Then create further subclasses like Dog, Eagle, and Salmon that inherit from the Mammal, Bird, and Fish classes, respectively.

Exercise 2: Vehicle Class Blueprint
Design a blueprint for a Vehicle class with attributes like make, model, and methods like start(), stop(), and drive(). Implement subclasses like Car, 
Motorcycle, and Bicycle, each inheriting from the Vehicle class. Then create further subclasses like ElectricCar and MountainBike that inherit from 
the Car and Bicycle classes, respectively.

Exercise 3: Employee Class Blueprint
Create a blueprint for an Employee class with attributes like name, employee_id, and methods like get_salary(). Implement subclasses like Manager, 
Developer, and SalesPerson, each inheriting from the Employee class. Then create further subclasses like SeniorDeveloper and JuniorDeveloper that 
inherit from the Developer class.

Exercise 4: Geometric Shape Class Blueprint
Design a blueprint for a Shape class with methods like area() and perimeter(). Implement subclasses like Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle, each 
inheriting from the Shape class. Then create further subclasses like Square, Ellipse, and EquilateralTriangle that inherit from the Rectangle, 
Circle, and Triangle classes, respectively.

Exercise 5: School Management System
Create a blueprint for a Person class with attributes like name, age, and methods like get_details(). Implement subclasses like Student, Teacher, 
and Principal, each inheriting from the Person class. Then create further subclasses like MathTeacher and PhysicsTeacher that inherit from the Teacher class.

These program exercises involve multi-level inheritance, where subclasses inherit from parent classes and can further serve as parent 
classes for other subclasses. This hierarchical structure allows for a more specialized and organized class system. You can implement 
these concepts by defining the classes and using multi-level inheritance to create the class hierarchy in Python code.
