1. **Nested Conditions:**
   Write a Python program that takes three integers as input and prints the largest among them, considering all possible combinations of nested `if` statements.

2. **Leap Year Checker:**
   Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. Consider the rules for leap years (divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400).

3. **Quadratic Equation Roots:**
   Write a program that takes coefficients of a quadratic equation as input and prints the roots, considering both real and complex roots. Use the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots.

4. **Grade Calculator:**
   Develop a program that takes a numerical score as input and prints the corresponding letter grade using the traditional grading scale (A, B, C, D, F).

5. **Temperature Converter:**
   Build a program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. Include user input for the temperature and the desired conversion direction.

6. **Vowel Counter:**
   Create a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) using `if` statements.

7. **Palindrome Checker:**
   Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. Consider ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter casing.

8. **Password Strength Checker:**
   Develop a program that checks the strength of a password based on various criteria, such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

9. **Triangle Type Identifier:**
   Implement a program that takes three sides of a triangle as input and classifies it as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. Also, consider whether it forms a right-angled triangle.

10. **Menu-driven Calculator:**
    Build a calculator program that performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input. Include error handling for division by zero and invalid operations.
