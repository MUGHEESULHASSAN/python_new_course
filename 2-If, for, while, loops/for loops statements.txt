1. **Prime Number Generator:**
   Write a Python program that generates and prints all prime numbers within a given range using a `for` loop.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence Printer:**
   Create a program that prints the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a `for` loop, where N is provided by the user.

3. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   Implement a program that multiplies two matrices using nested `for` loops. Ensure proper validation for matrix dimensions.

4. **Pascal's Triangle Generator:**
   Write a Python program that generates and prints Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows using nested `for` loops.

5. **Pattern Printer:**
   Develop a program that prints a pyramid pattern using a `for` loop. The height of the pyramid should be determined by user input.

6. **Factorial Calculator:**
   Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a `for` loop. Handle edge cases such as zero and negative numbers.

7. **Sum of Digits:**
   Write a program that calculates the sum of digits for a given integer using a `for` loop. Include error handling for non-integer inputs.

8. **String Reversal:**
   Implement a program that reverses a given string using a `for` loop. Consider using both iterative and slicing methods.

9. **Word Frequency Counter:**
   Develop a program that takes a sentence as input and prints the frequency of each word using a `for` loop. Ignore case and punctuation.

10. **Exponential Series:**
    Write a Python program that calculates the sum of the first N terms of an exponential series using a `for` loop, where N and the base of the series are provided by the user.
